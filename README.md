Yet another repo

Today, I went to National library in Beijing for the first time. I've been in Beijing more than one year but this is the first time I visited this library. It felt good to work in the library during weekends.

The library closed at 5:01 pm, and I went back to my office and stayed there until 9:30, then I went back home.

Feels a wonderful day.
